Fork of [Adam Burgess' Mono buildpack for Heroku](https://github.com/adamburgess/heroku-buildpack-mono), updated with latest mono cert-sync (with BTLS/TLS 1.2) and NuGet 4.1.0

#### oh no this is outdated what do i do?
When this inevitably becomes outdated again you can probably just copy over the cert-sync.cs from [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono) and get an updated NuGet commandline from [the official site](https://www.nuget.org/downloads). Hopefully Adam's CircleCI runner is still up by then. Fixing any problems caused by the passage of time is left as an exercise for the reader.

Here follows the rest of the original Readme. Just be careful not to use an old (pre-TLS 1.2) version of mono or the deploy will fail!

#### what to use this for

C# console apps running on the latest mono version, which is built daily. Or: choose any version of mono (starting from 4.0.4*)

Note: If you're running on ASP, use Heroku's unofficial official buildpack instead: [heroku/dotnet-buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/dotnet-buildpack).  
You can still run webservers; self-hosting OWIN and NancyFx work perfectly. I recommend [Nowin](//github.com/Bobris/Nowin).

#### how to use this

1. Put a solution in the root directory of your app
2. Use nuget to get dependencies
3. Run `heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/adamburgess/heroku-buildpack-mono` to set the buildpack
4. Optionally configure the version of mono using a `.mono` file
5. Add `mono ProjectName.exe` to your Procfile. Apps will be built into the root directory

#### more options

Create a `.mono` file to configure more options:

````bash
# put a tag name here that has a corresponding release to specify a version*
# omitting this will use the latest available mono version
MONO_VERSION=90450cc1480d
# specify the build you want, either minimal (default) or full
# see below for explanation
MONO_TYPE=minimal
# if this is set, the cache is not used/cleaned.
# the cache is used to 1) store mono builds and 2) store nuget packages
MONO_CACHE=nope
````

#### how your app is built

1. The latest version of mono is downloaded from the Releases
2. NuGet dependencies are restored
3. The solution is compiled using mono's `xbuild` (msbuild)

#### how mono is built

1. Someone pushes to [mono/mono](//github.com/mono/mono)
2. Mono's CI server, [Jenkins](//jenkins.mono-project.com/job/test-mono-mainline-linux/label=ubuntu-1404-amd64/), compiles and runs the test suite for mono.
3. A [scheduled task](//github.com/adamburgess/heroku-buildpack-mono-watcher) checks Jenkins daily to see if a new build has completed and passed all tests.
4. If it has, it creates a new commit in [adamburgess/heroku-buildpack-mono-builder](//github.com/adamburgess/heroku-buildpack-mono-builder) which makes [Circle CI](//circleci.com/gh/adamburgess/heroku-buildpack-mono-builder) start building Mono.
5. Once completed, it then creates a commit, tag, and release here, which is fetched by Heroku on building your app.

#### full vs minimal builds
The builder creates two versions of mono:

1. Full build. ~95mb slug size increase.
  * Includes everything, including libgdiplus, boehm, libraries (e.g. for use in mkbundle).

2. Minimal build. ~30mb slug size increase.
  * Removes shared libraries, boehm, header includes, System.Windows.Forms
  * libgdiplus is included

For most, the minimal build will work fine, and it is the default. Enable the full build if you need its resources or are having problems.

#### * I want version [x] of Mono. How can I get it?

Create a pull request in [adamburgess/heroku-buildpack-mono-builder](//github.com/adamburgess/heroku-buildpack-mono-builder) changing the `latest` file to the tag or commit that you want, and I'll merge and see that it builds successfully.
